I decided a couple of different things recently.  I needed a new website to better reflect "me".  I also decided to start some kind of blog to document my learning process as I continue this journey.

I decided that I would try to build a new site using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). This post is largely designed as a test while I am setting up the site.  In another post, I will detail my process as best as I can.
