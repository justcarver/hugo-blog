Well, it has been a productive few days.  I added this project to [GitHub] finally, and have made 23 commits since doing so.  I ended up completely finishing the entire basic HTML layout of my site, all pages are working, and you can navigate freely at this point.

Today, I mainly set up all my basic files for my SASS workflow and started working on the base styles for my site.  This included setting up my machine for the [syntax highlighting] included in [Hugo].

Now that I have my [Gulp] pipeline, I hope that this site will be in a much more veiwable state very shortly.  I would like to have this hosted soon, but I've been working mainly on more back end work, I had to remember how to set up my front end development environment. I will go into the tools I use more later.

I want to add a section to the site for Projects where I can go into detail about the different projects I have worked on, including what tools and techniques are being used.  I have to admit, [Hugo] was a bit confusing at first, but now that I understand how it works, I am definitly starting to like.
