Me.  I am Justin Carver.  Does that not answer your question well enough?  OK then.  Let me try to explain a bit better.

I am a software developer currently located in Louisville, KY.  I am currently employed at UPS as a Web Developer Specialist.

I am also currently serving as a Mentor for [Code Louisville].  This is a job training program that offers a series of 12-week tracks to adults looking for careers in the software development industry.  These programs are offered at no cost to the student.  I have mentored the Full Stack Javascript and the Front-End Web Development tracks from [Code Louisville].

I also previously completed the Front-End Web Development and the Back End Web Development - Ruby / Ruby on Rails tracks from [Code Louisville].  The curriculum of these programs is largely provided by [Treehouse].
